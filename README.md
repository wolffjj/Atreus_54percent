# Atreus_54percent
This is the repository for my Backlit, 58 key Atreus Keyboard.

The repository is a little messy right now, but hopefully the files are in working condition. Since I did a horrible job documenting ald labelling all of my pads, please let me know if the kiCAD files aren't workinf correctly.

I'll be slowly adding things and cleaning this up. I'm also currently working on a revision that will remove the Teensy 2.0 and solder the controller directly to the board, but don't count on that for a while, as this is just a hobby project :)

Expect case files soon, and a QMK build. I'm currently working on a case for PCB-mounted switches, as well. :)
